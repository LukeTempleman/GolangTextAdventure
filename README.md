# GolangTextAdventure
A text adventure game to practice GoLang 

# Roadmap
  Here is the entire roadmap on how im going about this project

    1)Basic Syntax and Variable Declaration
          The start menu is a simple introduction
          learning about Scanners/input aswell as standard output

    2)Data Types and Conditionals
          Can make a health system or even a coin system for the player
          
    3) Conditonals
          Level system and enemy versus player mechanics
          
    4) Concurruncy and go routines
          With this i can maybe implement a multiplayer mode in which you can connect to
          another player and fight them in parallel
          possibly over sockets? or an api
          
    5) Databases
          Can add a point system that saves the players scores into a database
          maybe even a loading point
          
    6) Frameworks
          Not sure how to implement just yet but good GO frameworks include:
          Gin - Web Framework
          GoGotEnv - To handle env's
          pq - A pure Go postgres driver for Go's database/sql package
